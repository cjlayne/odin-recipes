            <h3>Marinating The Chicken</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the lime juice, adobo sauce, paprika, cumin, and oregano.</li>
                    <li>Season the chicken with the salt and pepper, and place the chicken in the marinade.</li>
                    <li>Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and let marinate in the refrigerator for at least an hour ot overnight</li>
                </ol>
            <h3>Grilling The Chicken</h3>
                <ol>
                    <li>Remove the chicken from the marinade, letting the excess drip back into the bowl. Place chicken on a platter or plate and let sit at room temperature for about 30 minutes.</li>
                    <li>Heat a gas or charcoal grill to medium-high heat.</li>
                    <li>Add the chicken to the grill and cook until it is nicely charred, about 5 minutes. Turn the chicken over and cook until the other side has grill grill marks, about 5 minutes, and the chicken is cooked through.</li>
                    <li>Remove chicken from the grill and cut into 1/2-inch cubes</li>
                    <li>Warm tortillas on stove top or in microwave, add chicken to tortillas and top with any toppings you prefer.</li>
